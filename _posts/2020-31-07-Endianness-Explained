## Introduction
Endianness is the ordering of digital data in computer memory storage.<br/>
Endianness is primarily expressed as big-endian or little-endian.

## Little Endian
With little endian the most significant byte is stored at the highest address of the storage region and decreases the address for each less significant byte of data.<br/>Illustration:<br/>
